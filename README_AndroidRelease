Notes on compiling a release build for Android using flutter cmd line:

Create a file, key.properties, in "android" directory.

Should contain something like this:

	storePassword=secret
	keyAlias=upload_flutter
	keyPassword=same as store pwd
	storeFile=/home/donald_i/Dropbox/androidKeystore
	appId=uk.co.storlann.mothachas

Then review and edit the build.gradle file stored at android/app/build.gradle

Here you need to set or update the version id (an int) as well as the version string.

Check it is referencing the key file.

Check the AppId is correct (it may come from your key file or it might be hardcoded).

Then run "flutter build appbundle" to make the aab.

NB the easiest way to set your app icon is to use the flutter_launcher_icons package.
